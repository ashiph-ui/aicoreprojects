# *<u>Hangman Project</u>*

### Description
The aim of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game. The final product uses 'Object oriented programming' (OOP) to simulate an interactive hangman game experience.

### Skills I have Learnt:
- List comprehensions
- If-statements, for-loops and while loops
- Modularising code into functions
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Python files:

### <u>milestone2.py</u> 
A very basic program that randomly selects a word from a list of words. This list contains 5 fruit names.

Also, the program will ask an input of a single alphabetical letter as a guess. The program checks whether the guess is valid or not.

### <u>milestone3.py</u>
Extension to milestone2.

This file shows progression by addition of a new feature that checks whether the guess letter is in the word or not.

In this file the functions are made to modularise the code for better readability.

### <u>milestone4.py</u>
This milestone converts functions into methods with classes. A new class is made called 'Hangman', once initialised , all game methods are executed from the Hangman class.

This milestone additionally tracks player guesses and punishes incorrect guesses.
