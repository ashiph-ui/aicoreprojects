# *<u>Hangman Project</u>*

The aim of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game.

## Python files:

### <u>milestone2.py</u> 
A very basic program that randomly selects a word from a list of words. This list contains 5 fruit names.

Also, the program will ask an input of a single alphabetical letter as a guess. The program checks whether the guess is valid or not.

### <u>milestone3.py</u>
Extension to milestone2.

This file shows progression by addition of a new feature that checks whether the guess letter is in the word or not.

In this file the functions are made to modularise the code for better readability.
